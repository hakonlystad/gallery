                <p class="regText">At a mere 17 years old, Thomas Konow was the youngest participant at Eidsvoll national assembly of 1814. The book gives his view of the events around the devising of the norwegian constitution. 
                    Thomas Konow participated in the ratification and signing of a constitution which would not give him the right to vote for another seven years.</p>

                    Fabricius was the only high ranking officer answering the call, and Thomas Konow joined him.<br><br>The portrait is based on a painting by an unknown artist of the 19th century, but I needed to make him slightly younger.</p>
